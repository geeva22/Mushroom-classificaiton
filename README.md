		Mushroom Classification

Description:
	In the mushroom classification project, we will look at how we can create a machine learning model, an artificial neural network (ANN), to do classification prediction on a dataset.


Why: Problem Statement:
	The major problem in colleges or schools, the students who eat mushroom is it is safe to eat or deadly poison.


How: Solution description:
	Some mushrooms contain less toxic compounds and, therefore, are not severely poisonous. Poisonings by these mushrooms may respond well to treatment. However, certain types of mushrooms, contain very potent toxins and are very poisonous; so even if symptoms are treated promptly mortality is high. With some toxins, death can occur in a week or a few days. Although a liver or kidney transplant may save some patients with complete organ failure, in many cases there are no organs available. Patients hospitalized and given aggressive support therapy almost immediately after ingestion of amanitin-containing mushrooms have a mortality rate of only 10%, whereas those admitted 60 or more hours after ingestion have a 50â€“90% mortality rate.



How Unique:
	Many folk traditions concern the defining features of poisonous mushrooms. However, there are no general identifiers for poisonous mushrooms, so such traditions are unreliable. Guidelines to identify particular mushrooms exist and will serve only if one knows which mushrooms are toxic.


Customers:
	The general public people, families, everyone who eats mushrooms are the customer of this project.


Project phases and schedules:
	Built.
Train.
Test.
Split.


Algorithms Used:
	In this one, we'll look at how we can create a machine learning model, an artificial neural network ( ANN), to do classification predictions on a data set.


Resources Required:
	Tools used:  Anaconda - Python version 3.6.
					        Kaggle dataset.


Artificial neural networks (ANN) or connectionist systems are computing systems that are inspired by, but not identical to, biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems "learn" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with task-specific rules.
